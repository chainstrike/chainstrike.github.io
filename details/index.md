## ladies and gentlemen, 

we are pleased to announce the candidacy of
TEAM CHAiNSTRiKE  for nodes in NA/AR/SH. our members
have a long history in the crypto scene.

you want details? sure lets jump right in...    

## /home/jeezy
* long time investor of james projects       
* EU node operator since the beginning in 2016 
* nearly 15 years of IT-experience (win/nix)

## /home/dukeleto
* core dev of KMD, helping implement 2.0 vision
* core dev of HUSH, bringing secure coms to people
* started mining BTC and read Satoshis WP in 2011

## /home/rz1911
* backup operator for all nodes                 
* will mainly manage the social media accounts
* over 15 years experience in it-security

here are some details about our node in EU
that has been running since october 2016,
and what we want for our new nodes 

* industrial servers on a gbps backbone
* hosted in first class dc around the globe
* near perfect mining results every month
* one of the best performing nodes overall
* top notarization results, day by day
* uptime of 99%

so whats planned for 2018/2019 you ask?

pretty simple, keep the above mentioned
performance level  and  add three more nodes 
since we have all the experience and can put
in the workhours it should be an easy task,
but  most importantly we help KMD keep pumping
a healthy stream of notarizations.

but wait, there is even more

every 4 months we will drop back 10% KMD of the 
mined value to our voters. (only valid for public
voters) in addition we will payout 10% KMD of
the mined value to help projects chosen by the
team at our discretion.

this, in addition to our powerful team and the
fact that we bring the experience and willigness
to provide a stable notarization environment
to the table, should be enough to convince you
that voting for TEAM CHAiNSTRiKE is the only
logical conclusion!
